<h1>Working with Forms</h1>

<p>
	So far everything we have created has been about displaying content.
</p>

<p>
	But what about those time when you need a way to gather information from visitors to your site?
</p>	

<p>
	The process of creating an HTML form is fairly easy, but ensuring that the form is easy to understand, usable, and painless to fill out are what we will focus on.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-danger">
	<strong>Note:</strong> Typically you would have a script file to process your form input. For the purpose of this assignment we will focus mainly on properly building the form and thank you pages.
</p>

<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>

<p>
	Ben Marcato is the manager for the Scream’n Chicken Lips, a local up and coming band that blends genre-bending fusion of jazz, blues, and Norwegian Speed Polka.	
</p>

<p>
	Ben has contracted you to build a two page site for the band. The main page should have a blurb about the band (you can use any fake text generator) and should also have an order form offering memorabilia of the band. When an order is placed, the customer should be shown a thank-you page.
</p>

<p>
	The band sells three products: <strong style="color:LightSeaGreen;">CD’s</strong>, <strong style="color:MediumOrchid;">8-Track Tapes</strong>, and <strong style="color:Coral;">t-shirts.</strong> 
</p>

<p>
	The <strong style="color:LightSeaGreen;">CD’s</strong> that are available are <em style="color:LightSeaGreen;">“Me and My Mickey”</em>, <em style="color:LightSeaGreen;">“Who Will Cry for the Pimples?”</em>, and <em style="color:LightSeaGreen;">“No Time for Tofu”</em>.
</p>

<p>
	 Additionally, their fourth album, <em style="color:MediumOrchid;">“Live from the Velvet Tango Room”</em> is only available on <strong style="color: MediumOrchid;">8-track tape</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	The <strong style="color:Coral;">t-shirts</strong> are available in <em style="color:Coral;">small</em>, <em style="color:Coral;">medium</em>, and <em style="color:Coral;">large</em> sizes.
</p>

<p>
	Ben wants the order page to be clear, simple and easy for the general public to order from. Ben also cares about Web standards and wants appropriate form elements used. He wants the e-mail that will come from your form to be clear and easy to read as well, and to include all pertinent info from the customer. And he wants the customer to receive an attractive and courteous thank you page for the order.
