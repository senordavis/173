<h1>Site Portfolio</h1>

<p>
	Now that we have learned many of the basic techniques of displaying content, we will start to apply those techniques in many different ways.
</p>

<p>
	We will start out by creating a page that will be the homepage for you webspace.
</p>	

<p>
	This page will essentially be a portfolio, or main navigation to all the assignments for this class.
</p>


<hr />
	
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Create an attractive, well-designed introduction and index to your course work.</li>
	<li>Include a link to each assignment.</li>
	<li>Use Dreamweaver roll over images or CSS hover effects appropriately on the page.</li>
	<li>Follow good practices in HTML and CSS.</li>
	<li>Upload the page as the home page of your webspace.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>

<p>
	Create a portfolio homepage for your web site using Dreamweaver roll over images or CSS hover effects. Each menu item should take the user to one of your other assignments, and <strong><em>every assignment should have a link</em></strong>.	
</p>

<p>
	Links for future assignments might bring up a <em>"coming soon"</em> announcement.
</p>

<p>
	You will need to create and optimize your own graphics for this assignment. Beyond the requirement to use Dreamweaver roll over images or CSS hover effects, and link to your course assignments, the design of your page is entirely up to you, so this is a chance to flex your creativity. Visual composition counts, and so do technical aspects like correct markup and image optimization.

	<p class="lead"><strong>File management, file management, file management!</strong></p>

	<p>Your site should be organized as described in the <a href="https://d2l.lcc.edu/d2l/le/content/118288/viewContent/2890394/View" class="alert-link">File Management Demo Video</a>. Now is the time to clean it up if it is not. While you are cleaning up your files, be sure each of your pages has a title.</p>

<h3>File Naming</h3>

	<p>Save your page with the appropriate name(s), following the file naming convention<br /><em>(<span style="color:teal;"><strong>teal</strong></span> items are folders)</em>:</p>

<pre><code>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-file"></span> index.html
  <span style="color:teal;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-folder-open"></span> <strong>assignment-7</strong></span>
   <span style="color:teal;">&#8627; <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-folder-open"></span> <strong>css</strong></span>
       &#8627; <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-file"></span> style.css
   <span style="color:teal;">&#8627; <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-folder-open"></span> <strong>images</strong></span>
       &#8627; <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-picture"></span> your-own-image.jpg
</code>
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Your <code>index.html</code> file for this assignment is not located in the assignment folder but rather your root directory outside of all the assignment folders. All the other assignment files should be in the <code>assignment-7</code> folder.
