<title>Creating a Layout with CSS Assignment</title>

</head>
<body>
<h1>Layout with CSS</h1>

<p>
	There is an awesome amount of power in todayâ€™s web design tools. Those layout tools include the <strong>position/float/clear</strong> properties. When these three properties interact, the compositional possibilities are virtually endless.

</p>

<p>
	Thorough understanding of the <strong>box model</strong> and general CSS structure is a must for this lesson. If you have any questions please contact me.

<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>

	<p>
		Use the files and content from your Assignment 3 to create a new design. This time you must come up with your own layout and styles. You are welcome to create a whole new design or a design based on your previous one as long as at least one element is <strong>fixed</strong> or <strong>absolutely</strong> positioned.
	</p>

	
<div class="alert alert-warning" style="padding: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
	<p>
		<strong>Please note:</strong> You do not have to replicate the look of the example, only its logical structure. Different layout choices, text styling and colors are encouraged. You may substitute a different image if you like, and you may add headings to the text. Otherwise use the text as is. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Please also note:</strong> You may not use any of the layout templates provided in Dreamweaver for any of the work in this course, though you are welcome to study them for pointers. Those layouts are very handy tools you may want to use on your own, but for the purposes of this introductory course you need to learn to do your own markup and styling.
