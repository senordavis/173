<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>

<p>
Your about page may or may not be truthful and it need not have graphics or other bells and whistles. But it must us good markup.
</p>

<p>
	Your page will use the default styling that the browser will give it. However if you are already knowledgeable enough to use more sophisticated CSS or to add elements to your about  page, you certainly may do so&#8212;but the assignment is to produce a page that uses correctly marked-up text.


<p>Save your page with the appropriate name(s), following the file naming convention:</p>

<pre><code>
  index.html
</code>
</pre>

</div>
