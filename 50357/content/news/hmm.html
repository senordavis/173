		<strong style="font-size:24px;">Hey Everyone, </strong>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I hope that you all were able to get back in the swing of things after spring break and the time change.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I've been thinking about a couple things and wanted to send a message to everyone addressing them all.
		</p>

<h2>Grades</h2>

		<p>
		You should see that grades have been posted. If you did not have files loaded either in D2L or theartprogram.org server, I was not able to grade your assignments and thus could not give you credit for them. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Remember though that you can go back and do those assignment and submit them before the end of the 14<sup>th</sup> week of the semester for partial credit.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Assignment Updates
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			I have decided to drop the "Repurposing Print Materials" assignment. This will give us a bit more time for the two really important assignments. The current assignment, <a href="https://d2l.lcc.edu/d2l/le/content/118288/Home?itemIdentifier=D2L.LE.Content.ContentObject.ModuleCO-2903885">Site Portfolio</a>, and the Final Project.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To keep the same number of points for your final grade, the portfolio assignment will now be somewhat like a mid-term and is worth 20 points.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The <a href="https://d2l.lcc.edu/d2l/home/118288">video demo for the portfolio</a> assignment has been <a href="https://d2l.lcc.edu/d2l/home/118288">posted</a> and is available.

		<h2>
			Face to Face Office Hours
		</h2>	
		
		<p>
			I have received a few messages from people saying that they are feeling overwhelmed or struggling with the assignments. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<strong><em>If at any point you feel this way please let me know.</em></strong> I am here to help you learn this, and the only way that I can help you with that is if you let me know that you are having difficulties. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Please do not feel that your only option is to give up. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I have a face to face class that I teach on Monday and Wednesday Evenings at LCC's Main Campus from 6pm to 8pm. And I am typically there the entire hour before class starts, from 5pm to 6pm. If you would like to stop by during that hour please let me know and we can meet in GB 112. This way I can walk you through anything that you have questions about or answer any questions that you have.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If that time does not work for you, please contact me and let me know and we can try an connect at more convenient time.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I really want you all to succeed and learn this as it can be really fun once you get the hang of it.
		</p>
		
		<hr />
		
		<p>
			Good luck this week and let me know if you have any questions
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>-Mike</strong>
