		<strong style="font-size:24px;">Hey Everyone, </strong>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Sorry about getting you the Adding Media Demo video so late. What I've done is extend the deadline until this week, Saturday April 23.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
			Also it was pointed out to me over the weekend that there is an issue with using dropbox if you have a newly created account. What I found out after doing some digging is that Dropbox changed the public folder into a "Pro" feature, unless you had an account with them prior to 2012.
		</p>
		
		<p>Luckily I did find a work around with the current system that will still allow you to use Dropbox to host you media files.</p>
		
		<p>You can view that video, <a href="https://d2l.lcc.edu/d2l/le/content/118288/viewContent/2946469/View">Media Demo Video Update</a>, in the <a href="https://d2l.lcc.edu/d2l/le/content/118288/Home?itemIdentifier=D2L.LE.Content.ContentObject.ModuleCO-2866793">Adding Media Module</a>, or below. </p>

<h2>Final Project</h2>

		<p>
		I will be posting the details for your Final Project between today and tomorrow. You will have to work on the first part of it this week while finishing your Adding Media assignment. But it is a very easy part of your final project that it should not take you much time to get it done. 
		</p>
		

				<hr />
		
		<p>
			Good luck this week and let me know if you have any questions
		</p>

		<p>
