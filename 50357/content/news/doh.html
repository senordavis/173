		Hey Everyone, 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This has been such a crazy week!
		</p>

		<p>
		So on top of the fact that LCC was closed on Thursday and half the day on Wednesday due to weather. I was having massive computer issues this week that kept me from getting the tables demo video up in a timely manner.
		</p>
		
		<hr/>
		
		<h2>
			So what does that all mean for you?
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			For some people who do work in the computer labs, it was impossible to get work done for almost 2 days this week. And for those of you who use like to use the demo videos I post, you didn't have more than yesterday and today to use it. So I will be extending the tables assignment deadline. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To those of you who took a stab at getting this done and have turned something in already, you are free to stay with what you have, or work on the assignment next week to turn in again.
		</p>
		
		<h2>
			What about next weeks assignment?
		</h2>	
		
		<p>
			To keep on track for the rest of the semester you will still have an assignment next week. So you will be working on the tables and the forms assignments at the same time.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The forms assignment is fairly easy and you should be able to work on both assignments during the week.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If you have any questions please feel free to email me directly or through D2L.
		</p>
