		Hey Everyone, 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I know that I have already written to some of you individually, but I wanted to send something out to everyone to hopefully calm some nerves, and reduce everyone's stress level.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I have been having a very difficult time getting the CSS demo video put together and published. It still is currently running through another encoding process. I'm hoping that the modifications that I made will result in a file that I can post for you to view.
		</p>
		
		<hr/>
		
		<h2>
		So what does that all mean for you...
		</h2>
		
		<p>
		To be fair for everyone, I will be extending the deadline of the CSS assignment to be due next week, Saturday February 6, instead of in a few days.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To those of you who took a stab at getting this done and have turned something in already, you are free to stay with what you have, or work on the assignment next week to turn in again.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To those who have been waiting for the video and have not been able to figure out how to do this assignment, I apologize for not having the necessary materials ready for you.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		If you have any questions please feel free to email me directly or through D2L.
		</p>
