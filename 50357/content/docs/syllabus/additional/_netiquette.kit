<h2>Netiquette</h2>

<p>
	Netiquette (or network etiquette) is commonly defined as a set of principles developed to express courtesy and help people communicate appropriately while sending e-mail and using the Internet. The Instructor and course participants alike will demonstrate etiquette and civility whenever interacting with each other. Please use standard “Business English” (complete sentences) and avoid jargon or slang when communicating.

	Consider anything said in public forums (Web-based applications explored in this course, our discussion forums, and when giving feedback to other participants) to be public information. Do not post/make comments that may be considered controversial, abrasive, in poor taste, or may reveal too much personal information - protect your privacy.
