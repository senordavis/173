		</p>
		
		<p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal;">
			I've been thinking about how to have you turn in assignments. Currently you turn things in to two places. And I have decided that instead of having you turn in your assignments to both D2L and the server, you will just turn things into the server through Dreamweaver. This change will be reflected on the assignment sheets as well.

			If you have any questions please let me know.
