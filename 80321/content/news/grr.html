		<strong style="font-size:24px;">Hey Everyone, </strong>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<strong style="font-size:18px; color: red;">I'm Angry with Dropbox!</strong> I'm not mad at any of you.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			My apologies for the video and audio troubles.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
			So it turns out that neither method will work to host the video or audio files with Dropbox.
		</p>
		
		 <p>
			 The article that I found and was referencing when making the updated dropbox video was from a few months ago, and since then Dropbox has updated their service again.
		 </p>

<p>So what I have set up is a few video backgrounds that can be used instead. I know that they will not be the same as your design intended, but this way you can test and make sure that your code is working.</p>

<p>You can find the video file here: <a href="http://mdavis.x10.mx/assets/videos">mdavis.x10.mx/assets/videos</a></p> 

<p>You can find the audio file here: <a href="http://mdavis.x10.mx/assets/audio">mdavis.x10.mx/assets/audio</a> </p>

<p>To add it to your code, just right click on the video or audio file you wish to use, copy the link, then paste it into your source field in Dreamweaver.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any issues or questions.</p>

<h2>Final Project</h2>

		<p>
		I'm so sorry about this. I was meaning to have the details posted for you early this week, and that did not happen.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Here a quick overview so you can get started working:<br />
				<ul>
					<li>
						Create a Website of your own choosing and design.
						<small style="color: gray;">(No political, religious, or sexually-oriented sites)</small>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						Must have a working form.
						<small style="color: gray;">(It can be just like Assignment 6)</small>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<strong>Must have at least 5 pages</strong>
						<small style="color: gray;">(Yes the form page and the thank you page count as pages)</small>
					</li>
				</ul>
		</p>
		

				<hr />
		
		<p>
			Let me know if you have any questions.
		</p>
