<h1>Working with Tables</h1>

<p>
	When using creating content for you pages, there will be many times when you have different information that needs to be displayed in a different format. One of those types of content is tabular data.
</p>

<p>
	When you have tabular data you should use an HTML table. Tables can be used to display data in rows and columns. In addition, you can also create HTML tables to organize information on your web page. 
</p>	

<p>
	The process of creating an HTML table is similar to the process that you used to create your web page and any elements that you may have already included in your page, such as images or links.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-danger">
	<strong>Note:</strong> Prior to the creation of CSS, HTML <code>table</code> elements were often used as a method for page layout. This usage has been discouraged since HTML 4, and the <code>table</code> element should not be used for layout purposes.
</p>

<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>

	Select from one of three exciting topics:	
</p>

<ul>
		<li><em>Microwave Instructions</em></li>

		<li>or the <em>Top 10 Grossing Films</em></li>

	Turn the provided data into a properly structured HTML page and TABLE. Use one and only one table to display the data on the page, including the caption, and headers.
