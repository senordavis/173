<h1>Final Project</h1>

<p>
	Build an entire web site showing your passion for something you feel strongly about. Perhaps you have a cat? Build a detailed site about its breed. Or maybe you're into genealogy? You can tell us all about it. The possibilities are nearly endless. You are welcome to work on developing a real site, for your own purposes, for a friend, for a non-profit, etc., so long as you meet the course requirements.
</p>

<p>
	This needs to be as real as possible, <strong>so do not use Lorem Ipsum (or any other filler text)</strong>; on the other hand, do not steal text or graphics from other sources.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Create a Website of your own choosing and design.</li>
</ul>




	<ul>
		<li>No political, religious, or sexually-oriented sites.</li>
		<li>Your site must have no fewer than five (5) pages.
			<small style="color: gray;">(Yes the form page and the thank you page count as pages)</small>
		</li>
		<li>Your site must have a working form.
			<small style="color: gray;">(It can be just like Assignment 6)</small>
		</li>
		<li>Upload the site to your course webspace, even if you mean to use it elsewhere.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>

<p>
	Your site must have five pages, but take this opportunity to show off your grasp of behaviors, forms, and the like. I'll be looking at the professionalism, overall design and functionality of your site along with detail items like filenames, file organization, graphics optimization and so forth.
</p>

<h3>File Naming</h3>

	<p>Save your page with the appropriate name(s). Following is an example of the file naming convention<br /><em>(<span style="color:teal;"><strong>teal</strong></span> items are folders)</em>:</p>

<pre><code>
  <span style="color:teal;"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-folder-open"></span> <strong>Final</strong></span>
   &#8627; <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-file"></span> index.html
   &#8627; <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-file"></span> about.html
   &#8627; <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-file"></span> work.html
   &#8627; <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-file"></span> contact.html
   &#8627; <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-file"></span> thanks.html
   <span style="color:teal;">&#8627; <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-folder-open"></span> <strong>css</strong></span>
