<h1>CSS Animation</h1>

<p>
	With the introduction of CSS 3 we are now capable of animating objects. Support for this is rapidly growing amongst the major browsers. When used properly, animation on the web can add a touch of interest to your pages.
</p>

<p>
	The human brain is hardwired to pay attention to moving objects. Because of this natural reflex to notice movement, adding animation to your website is a powerful way to draw users attention to important areas of your site and add interest to your design.
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Create a fun, purposeful animation using CSS3.</li>
	<li>If your animation loops, it must cycle seamlessly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>
