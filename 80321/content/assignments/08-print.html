<h1>CSS for Print</h1>

<p>
	As we continue to build things for the web, we need to address the various media that will be using our pages.
</p>

<p>
	While it may seem surprising to some, printing webpages is a very common occurrence, and one that we must remember to take into account when creating our designs.
</p>	

<p>
	CSS 3 media types and media queries allow us to target various devices, screen widths, resolutions, and media. Making it much easier to style the same content in a myriad of ways without having to change the content at all, just which stylesheet is being used.

<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>

<p>
	Using multiple style sheets, create a single HTML page that is designed well and is for use on screen and also in print. Your screen design should be designed for the screen and will have things like a header, some content (filler text is okay), and a footer. The print version should have the same ‘feel’ as the screen version but it should be designed for print. Each version of your design should hide or modify elements that are not appropriate for the other media type. For example, if you might hide a menu or change the link styles for the print version
