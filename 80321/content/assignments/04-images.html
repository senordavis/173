<title>Images for Web Assignment</title>

</head>
<body>
<h1>Images for Web</h1>

<p>
	One of the most important things when using images for your website is to watch the file size of images. Many times you can have a wonderfully designed site, but if your images are too big, then no one will wait around for them to load.

</p>

<p>
	This assignment is about prepping images for the web, not about your Photoshop skills so do not use any filters and donâ€™t alter the images in any way beyond scaling and sharpening. 
</p>	


<p class="alert alert-danger">
	<strong>Note:</strong> Your storage space on the server is capped at 5mb! That is enough space for all of your ARTS 173 files as long as you do not upload files that do not belong there, like .psd designs.
</p>

<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>

<p>
	This assignment will be using real life images from <a href="http://elenamyers.com/" target="_blank">Elena Myers</a>. Elena has been very kind to give us permission to use these images of her for this assignment. Elena has our website address and may be checking in from time to time.
</p>

<p>
	Use the content provided to build a multi-page website for Elena Myers. Elena is a top ranked female motorcycle racer. In fact, Elena became the first female racer to win a professional level race at the Daytona International Speedway. And she did it with a broken wrist. This assignment is setup to demonstrate how many web jobs are put together. Often your client will have text they wish to use and even specific photos. Such is the case here. Use the images and text provided to build a professional looking page for Elena.
</p>

<p>
	You have copy for at least three pages and six images.
</p>

<p>
	Try to make the images look as good as possible at the smallest possible file size.
</p>

<p>
	You are free to use other graphics as support to the 6 you have been given, but please do not use other images. Support images would be drop shadows, background textures, and the like. Using photos of other racers or other sponsors, for example, are not.
